# Basics

## Objective
- Write simple Java programs
- Use conditional and looping statements
- Use arrays and strings
- Use command line arguments

## Problems

### 1. List Even Numbers
Write a program to list all even numbers less than or equal to the number n. The value of n is given through the command line as input to the program.

### 2. Array Sum and Average
Create an array of integers by reading values from the user. Display the sum and average of the integers. Also, display the number of values less than the average.

### 3. Simple Calculator
Write a program that accepts two numbers and an operator like (+, -, *, /) as command line arguments and perform the appropriate operation indicated by the operator.

### 4. BINGO Game
Write a program that accepts a number in the range 1 to 50 from the Command Line. It then compares the number against a single dimension array of five integer elements ranging in value from 1 to 50. The program displays the message "BINGO" once the given input is found in the array.

### 5. Word Reversal and Sorting
A set of 5 words is given. Write a program to reverse each word and arrange the resulting words in alphabetical order.

### 6. Reverse Array of Strings
1. **Task Description**: The task is to print the array of strings in reverse order.
2. **Operations to Perform**:
  - Create an array of strings.
  - Display the elements of the reversed array.
3. **Array**:
  ```java
  courses = { "Java Web Services", "Spring Data REST", "Hibernate", "Spring in easy steps" }

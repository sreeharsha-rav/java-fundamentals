## IO Streams

This project covered essential concepts of Java I/O streams and file handling. Let's review the tasks I completed and how they were implemented.

### Problem 1: Copy File
Implemented a Java program named `CopyFile` to copy contents from a source file to a destination file. This program handles scenarios where the source or destination files may not exist, and prompts the user to decide whether to overwrite the destination file if it already exists.

### Problem 2: File Write and Read
Created a program called `FileWrite` to interactively read 5 lines of text input from the user. The program then writes this input to a file named `letter.txt` and displays the file's size. Additionally, it reads the contents of `letter.txt` and prints them to the console before deleting the file.

### Problem 3: Directory Listing
Developed a Java class named `DirectoryList` to prompt the user to enter a directory name. This program checks if the directory exists and lists all files and subdirectories present within it if it does. If the directory does not exist, it displays a corresponding message.

### Problem 4: Employee Serialization
Implemented an application named `WriteEmployee` to serialize and deserialize employee details. The program prompts the user to enter employee information, creates an `Employee` object, and stores its details in a file named `emp.ser`. It then reads the employee details from `emp.ser` and displays them.
